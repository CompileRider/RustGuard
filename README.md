## Description

**RustGuard** is a real-time cheat detection system for Minecraft servers. It operates as a transparent proxy, requiring no modifications to the existing server, and works with any Minecraft version through proper protocol configuration.

Automatically detects cheats such as:

* Speed hacks
* Fly hacks
* Kill Aura
* X-Ray
* Auto-clicker
* Inventory hacks

Each anomaly triggers immediate alerts to Discord with detailed information: coordinates, speed, timestamp, and detected cheat type.

## Advantages

### For administrators:

* 24/7 detection without manual supervision
* Instant Discord alerts
* Objective and verifiable data
* History of suspicious players
* Less manual work and speculation

### For the community:

* Fairer gameplay
* Better overall experience
* Greater trust in the server

### Technical:

* Does not modify the server
* Compatible with multiple versions
* Scalable and efficient
* Fully customizable

## Project Status
