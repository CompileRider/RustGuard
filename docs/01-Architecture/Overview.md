# Architecture Overview

## System Design

RustGuard operates as a transparent TCP proxy between Minecraft clients and the server.

## Core Principles

### 1. Zero Server Impact
- Runs as separate process
- Server never blocked by anti-cheat
- If proxy crashes, server continues

### 2. Transparent Operation
- Players connect normally
- No client modifications needed
- Seamless experience for legitimate players

### 3. Context-Aware Detection
- Understands server plugins
- Accounts for custom items
- Recognizes safe zones
- Prevents false positives

### 4. Performance First
- Async/await with Tokio
- Zero-copy packet handling
- Efficient memory usage
- Scales to thousands of players

## Data Flow

### Inbound (Client â†’ Server)
